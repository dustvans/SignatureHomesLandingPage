# Signature Homes Landing Page

This project is a website development project that consists of two phases. The goal of the project is to create a simple HTML/CSS website to showcase the concept in the first phase, followed by the implementation of a special page in the second phase. The special page will allow the website owner to add and delete certain elements, such as available homes, along with their corresponding photos and videos.

## First Phase

In the first phase of the project, a basic HTML/CSS website will be created. The purpose of this phase is to demonstrate the concept and provide a visual representation of the website's design and layout. The website will be developed using HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling. This phase will primarily focus on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly website that effectively conveys the desired concept.

## Second Phase

The second phase of the project involves the implementation of a special page that enables the website owner to manage certain aspects of the website. The special page will provide functionalities to add and delete information about available homes. This includes adding details such as property descriptions, photos, and videos. The website owner will have the ability to update the information dynamically through the special page, ensuring the website stays up-to-date with the latest available homes.

### Functionalities to be implemented:

1. Add Home: The website owner will be able to add new homes to the website's listing by providing relevant information such as address, price, description, and media (photos/videos).
2. Delete Home: The website owner will have the capability to remove homes from the website's listing.
3. Update Home Information: The website owner will be able to edit the details of existing homes, including property descriptions, photos, and videos.
